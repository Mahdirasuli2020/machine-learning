# Predicting Cheese Fat Levels: A Machine Learning Approach

In this project, I explore how machine learning models can predict the fat levels in different types of Canadian cheese.
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the fat levels in various types of Canadian cheeses. By leveraging data and advanced algorithms, we aim to create a reliable tool for cheese enthusiasts, producers, and consumers.
